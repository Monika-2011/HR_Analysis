# 📊 HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it increases hiring costs and impacts productivity.  
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand the key factors that influence attrition and helps HR teams take data-driven decisions to retain employees.

The analysis is performed using Python, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.
